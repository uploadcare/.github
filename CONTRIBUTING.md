# Contributing to Uploadcare

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to our **API wrappers & Uploaders**!

Uploadcare consists of:
* **Upload API** to upload files
* **REST API** to manage uploaded files, file groups, and projects
* **Transformations** to transform uploaded files on-the-fly
* **Uploaders** (web, iOS, and Android) which replaces system uploader with a powerful customizable UI

Take a look at our [documentation](http://uploadcare.com/docs/) to find out how it works.
